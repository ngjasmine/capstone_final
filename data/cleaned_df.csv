‘Stanley’ anodised paint finish (inspired by the hotel in the movie The Shining, which is down the road from Moots’ HQ in Colorado).
Titanium stem with anodised logo. 
Titanium seatpost with extra anodised logo.
Comes with a spare Moots titanium seatpost with a setback (also with Moots logo).
Titanium seat clincher with extremely intuitive fore and aft adjustment. 
ENVE carbon bars 40cm.
Moots+Silca custom titanium computer mount with light / Go-pro mount underneath.
Titanium cages (you will NEVER lose your bottles with these!)
ENVE SES AR 3.4 rims (currently wearing Conti GP5000 32mm rubber) with Chris King hubs.
Electronic SRAM Force AXS WIDE 2x (43/30) 12sp (10-36). Note the WIDE - this Moots model requires it by design. 
Ceramic speed bottom bracket. 
The 3D printed saddle is 130mm; I can swap it for a Specialized Power 143mm if needed.
Bike built up last October by Bikes n Bites in Singapore, a fantastic Moots dealer (and shout out to Jerome).
A few scuffs from standard (road-only) use - fortunately any scuffs add character on a Ti frame. 
This bike from Moots with this paint scheme and extras would be SGD18k+, not to mention several months’ wait. 
Weight with cages, computer and light mounts (no pedals) and Conti GP5k 32mm tyres: 8.4kg. 
Pics from when new; pic 10 current (to show minor and hard to see scuff). 
This is the most comfortable bike I’ve owned - the titanium frame soaks up road chatter in a different way to carbon. On 35mm gravel tyres it’s pillowy, and on slick road tyres it smooths out crashy road imperfections.

Well kept, stiff but comfortable 
Fixed Price

The Scenero of two years ago was a sublime ride, but if something can be more sublime – sublimer perhaps – then this is it. The Scenero’s balance of stiffness in the right places means that any increase in cadence is instantly rewarded with hyper-speed acceleration momentum. Every watt of your power seems to be directly delivered to the rear wheel, pushing you forward, fast.

Power is, of course, nothing without control, and the G2 handles with a dizzying blend of sharpness and precision – a minimum twitch of your body and the lightest touch on the bar results in a point-and-shoot response that makes you feel like a hero even if you’re just turning into your drive. 

Credit here to the awesome Stiletto fork – it’s laterally stiff but it kills vibration and chatter from the road. The Scenero holds its line with absolute dedication and changes direction so fast from small inputs we reckon it’s the kind of bike a fighter pilot would nonchalantly lean up against his Typhoon.",N,,,Y,39A Jalan Pemimpin,mud11,Joined 3 years ago,Mostly Responsive,Verified,1.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,8,https://www.carousell.sg/p/high-end-storck-scenario-size-56-l-aero-bike-8kg-with-pedal-1121700547/?t-id=dif5P0Y2mE_1689399375099&t-referrer_browse_type=categories&t-referrer_category_id=247&t-referrer_page_type=category_browse&t-referrer_request_id=UtvBMiLOA9UC6cr6&t-referrer_search_query_source=direct_search&t-referrer_sort_by=&t-tap_index=57,,,"High end Storck Scenario size 56 (L) Aero Bike 8kg with pedal German technology 8kg with Fulcrum racing nite wheels aluminium 1.75m -1.85m Can trade with bromptons Selling without pedal and seat Full ultegra  Well kept, stiff but comfortable  Fixed Price The Scenero of two years ago was a sublime ride, but if something can be more sublime – sublimer perhaps – then this is it.

Don't miss this excellent opportunity to own a well-maintained Giant FastRoad Advanced bicycle. As the first and proud owner, I'm selling this bike only because I've upgraded to a new one. It's been ridden less than 1,000km and has been carefully maintained throughout its use.

🚲 Excellent Condition: This bike is in great shape, with only minor cosmetic scratches on the front fork and seat post. After every ride, I've thoroughly cleaned it with a high-quality cleaner lotion and made sure the chain is well-waxed for smooth performance.

🚲 Size & Fit: Perfect for riders around 165cm tall, this size S bicycle features a sleek charcoal-colored carbon composite frame and fork for a lightweight and durable ride.

🚲 Comfortable Upgrades: Enjoy a more comfortable ride with the upgraded West Biking Cushion seat and a free bonus bottle cage and bull horn for added convenience.

🚲 Reliable Components: Equipped with Shimano Tiagra 20-speed shifters, derailleurs, and an RS400 crankset, this bike offers smooth, reliable shifting. Tektro HD-R210 hydraulic disc brakes provide excellent stopping power, and tubeless-ready Giant SR2 disc rims with Gavia Fondo 2 tires ensure a stable and responsive ride.

Bike is well used with noticeable flaws. Seat post clamp has corrosion but was reinforced with epoxy. No seat post slippage issues since day 1. Frame has some scratches from transport/races. Never crashed. 

Full disclosure: I’m the 2nd owner of this bike. I’ve clocked 4000km on it. Do reach out if you’re keen and we can discuss more! Bike was brought into Singapore from Europe by 1st owner, hence no warranty help from Treknology. 

Selling because I’d like to focus my time on my road bike. Will like to spend my money on overseas cycling trips with my friends & family instead of race fees 😅 

Will include charger and other cockpit configurations / spare screws. Bottle cages & profile design aero bottle will be given as well

Can the same performance of the bicycle that won the 2020 Tour of Lombardy be condensed in a competitively priced ride?
It is in the Wilier 0 SL, the bike that adopts most of the characteristics of the bicycles used by Astana Premier Tech members Jakob Fuglsang, Alexey Lutsenko and Aleksandr Vlasov.
It guarantees the lightest weight, greatest steering precision and cleanest lines with fully frame-integrated cables, so that every outing becomes your greatest.

Extremely comfortable, lightweight for (speed), & easily foldable for (conveniency). Super handy-size to easily bring up on buses, train, car, & etc for a nice chill windy exploration trip.

The best you can ever get at such a price especially when it’s only used a few times.
If you’re a bike enthusiast you’ll definitely know what i mean.

(Look at last image of what the original retail price is going for).

Also not to worry, I will guide u on how to easily fold the bike during our meet up you can take a video for easy future reference.

Some unique features include:

TORAY T800 Carbon Fiber Frame + Fork, provides a stiffness pedaling platform while keeping the bike lightweight, resulting in swift handling and start.

Push Assist Wheels design, you can push it to walk and forward, no need to carry much weight when changing transportation ways anymore.

12,1,🔥Merida scultura ( rival edition)  hot sale 🔥,"4,400",Brand new,Meetup,3 weeks ago,Road Bikes,Posted,Never used. May come with original packaging or tag.,"Brand  new 

Built around the new wireless Rival groupset from SRAM the SCULTURA RIVAL EDITION takes clean lines to new heights. With its new streamlined frame and updated cable management, the new SCULTURA brings low weight and class-leading comfort to the table, while the wireless setup doesn’t even show the slightest stretch of cable near the two derailleurs. Upgraded aerodynamics paired with impressive handling and remarkable comfort make the RIVAL EDITION a true allrounder.

New for 2022, we are excited to present the 5th generation of our lightweight racer. While incorporating selected aero details from our test and award-winning REACTO aero bike, the new SCULTURA is the most aerodynamic ever. Yet, it remains true to its lightweight, agility and rider comfort focus; in fact it takes these factors to the next level. The new SCULTURA demonstrates outstanding compliance, providing the rider with class-leading riding comfort that will help to keep the body fresh for the final sprint or ascent. The new CF5 and CF3 carbon versions share their geometry with our REACTO, given the rider Team Bahrain Victorious race-proven handling. Available in carbon and aluminium and as either disc brake or rim brake option, our classic road bike combines outstanding comfort with whippet-like acceleration and class-leading climbing pedigree.

- 2021 frame set, bought from KHCycle in December 2021, built and collected in January 2022
- Comes with the latest aero post 3 and ADH handlebar combo
- 110mm LOOK stem
- Dura-Ace R9100 drivetrain 
- SRAM Force carbon crank arms with AbsoluteBlack oval rings (DUB spindle)
- Quarq dual sided powermeter
- BB Infinite Ceramitech bottom bracket 
- Vortex No Compromise N6 60mm full carbon spokes wheel set, Vittoria Corsa NEXT tubeless tires
- DT Swiss hub internals upgraded to 54T
- Fizik Argo Vento R5 155mm saddle
- Ultegra pedals

Full setup and a complete bike for a new owner. Extremely beautiful bike to ride on, balancing both comfort and aero positions on any rides. Quality is equally as good as those known market brands, LOOK is cheaper because it does lesser marketing hence doesn’t have the consumers pay for it. 

I had a fall at a traffic light as I lost my balance after another rider accidentally bumped into me. Hit a kerb which explains those scratches. My legs protected the down tube but not able to save the rear stays and front forks.

Émonda SL is a lightweight road bike using high-value 500 Series OCLV Carbon. Made for flying up climbs and fast group rides alike, Émonda SL has all the advantages of a lightweight ride with the added benefit of aero tube shaping.


I’m selling off my beloved roadie which had kept me company for 4+ years.
Reason for selling: upgrading

A female rider which took care of her bike meticulously and with tender loving care.
There are some scratches but does not affect the functionality of the bike.

I have upgraded a few parts on this bike. 
So if you are thinking of upgrading or getting into road cycling or want a faster bike, but do not want to burn a big hole in your pocket and feel the $$ pain, then go for this entry / mid-level bike.

You have everything you need in this bike to kickstart your roadie journey!

See the specs below:

Model: Trek Emonda SL5
Size: 47 (suitable for 152-158cm, inseam 71-75cm)
Colour: Matte Black
Frameset: Carbon (500-series OCLV)
Wheelset: Roval Rapide CLX 50 (upgraded - worth $3000)   
Tires: Pirelli Pzero Velo 700x25c (upgraded - worth $180) 
Drivetrain: Shimano 105 2x11spd
Pedals:Shimano PD-R7000 (Upgraded- worth $170)
Saddle: Astute Miss Line Ladies Saddle (Upgraded - worth $249)
Handlebar tape: Supercaz Bling tape (upgraded - worth $45)
Weight ~ 8kg

I will throw in the following:-
- Original Bontrager Aluminium wheelset  (can use as spare)
- Stock flat pedals (if you want to switch to clip pedals or use as spare)
- 1 Water Bottle Cage Holder

All these for only $2500! It’s a steal!

Selling a used Canyon Endurace AL7 Movistar Edition road bike with a 105 rim groupset. Perfect for cycling enthusiasts looking for a reliable and stylish ride.

This Canyon Endurace AL7 Movistar Edition has been well-maintained.

Other than that the frame and all other parts are in mint condition and ready to hit the road without any immediate repairs or upgrades necessary as I've recently brought it for servicing as well as replaced the chain, bar tape and saddle.

🌟 Features:
1. Eye-catching Movistar team-inspired design.

2. Lightweight aluminum frame, about 8.75kg, comparable to some carbon frame bikes.

3.Carbon fork for a smooth ride.

4. Shimano 105 groupset for precise shifting.Comfortable saddle and an upgraded Prime Ergonomic Handlebar (Worth about $100).

Cheaper than original since it reflects the production cost of the frame instead of the huge marketing and r&d cost. 

Higher maximum weight limit as the frames uses more layers of carbon fiber. This is to ensure that the frame will not be as fragile as the original. Weight limit is 180kg on the OEM frame compared to the original. 

No difference visually compared to original with superb paintwork. 

CONS :
Heavier weight ~150g heavier than original as the frame uses thicker layers of carbon fiber. 

FRAMESET INCLUDES HEADSET BEARINGS STEM CAP ETC. 

COLOURS ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE PICTURES ABOVE. IF YOU SEE A COLOURWAY YOU LOVE JUST SEND ME A PICTURE.

May come with original packaging or tag.,"Winning race bikes have just the right balance of lightweight, stiffness and smooth compliance on the road. The all-new TCR Advanced delivers on all three and adds updated aero performance to make it a versatile performer for competitive road riders.

With a new composite frameset that shaves every gram possible without sacrificing its pedal-stomping stiffness, the TCR Advanced is built for all-rounder road performance. Reengineered with aero shaped frame tubing, it helps you climb faster, hammer the flats more efficiently, and corner on rails. The OverDrive steerer system and MegaDrive downtube are engineered for precise handling, and the Variant seatpost delivers an ideal blend of efficiency and compliance—so you stay fresh until the finish on those big days in the saddle.

Class-leading efficiency
Lightweight composite materials and reengineered tubing shapes result in livelier ride quality, explosive acceleration and improved climbing efficiency with greater torsional frame stiffness than key competitor bikes.

Advanced aerodynamics
This is where the TCR’s most quantifiable gains can be found compared to previous-generation models. Every tube shape was analyzed, engineered and tested to create an overall structure with significantly lower drag at a wider range of yaw angles. The result is a TCR that’s faster than ever in sprints and solo situations.

Total control
An all-new composite fork boasts impressive torsional stiffness for unrivalled steering precision. And a Giant wheelset with tubeless technology allows you to run lower tire pressures for increased grip and a reduced risk of punctures.

The new TCR Advanced series features an all-new frame and fork to deliver all-rounder road performance from the mountains to the flats.

Note:
This is a frameset ONLY. new in an unopened box.

17,1,About us,0,Brand new,Meetup,2 weeks ago,Road Bikes,Bumped,Never used. May come with original packaging or tag.,"Welcome to Sengkangbikeshop:)

We specialize in performance road bike servicing, 
we have been in Operation full time for close to about 2 years now and since we started we have serviced thousands of road bikes ranging anywhere from Trek madone, sworks venge, Canyon aeroad to custom titanium bikes such as no22 and enigmas to vintage trek oclv carbon bikes.

We are also official dealers of multitudes of different brands such as enve,chris king and many more. 

Our service model is to provide not just excellent service to our clients but also at a reasonable price point. Importantly we want to provide a service that benefits our clients and not just for the sake of it. 
If certain services or upgrades aren't necessary we simply wont do them or suggest them outright.

Our tools we use are of the highest quality also so that means no cheap inaccurate torque wrenches or cheap easily malleable hex keys for example. 

We use park tool THH-1 Allen keys,Shimano pro Team digital torque wrenches,park tool professional workstands, Vessel JIS screw drivers,high quality workbenches, Japanese pliers and tools, countless sets of bearing presses for BB,headset and wheel bearings, Professional park tool bleeding kits,Rear derailleur hanger alignment tools even our cleaning station we use a professional work stand as well, and we often have multiple sets of the above mention tools as well, We hand lube all our cables and outers. Every bike is built and serviced to the specific specifications. We invest in these tools because it’s our passion and to be frank we are in this for the long haul and these tools not allow us to work better but faster as well to provide faster turnover rates.

For our cleaning purposes, we use specialized cleaners and degreasers sourced directly from a local bio chemical company and also have been constantly finding better ways of cleaning ur components to give you an even better then new bike feeling.

That being said we also do mtb,foldies,mini velos etc, although we are specialized in road bikes we are more then adequate to handle whatever other needs you may have :) 

Whatever you can think of or want we can create it and do it for you just give us a message we will help you out regardless.

18,6,Hope Rx4+,180 200,Like new,Meetup,3 weeks ago,Road Bikes,Bumped,Used once or twice. As good as new.,"Background:

Bought this set of Hope RX-4+ brake calipers from a Carouseller and realise that the back caliper had a Sticky piston. (Super common for Hope brake system apparently) so I thought I could go ahead and release this piston by assembling it on my bike. 

Until I realised that the piston could not retract and had to be replaced with a new one in order to use it again.

Having said that, this set had been set up before but not ridden on the road. So instead of lying in my store, I am open to selling this to anyone whom like to try fixing a sticky piston.

This is for Shimano brake only. Dura Ace, Ultegra, 105, does not matter. Only mineral brake fluid. Flat mount and support MTB if your frame is Flat mount.

15,7,Trifox x8 rim brake frameset size 54,300,Well used,Meetup,1 week ago,Road Bikes,Posted,Has minor flaws or defects.,"Selling my trifox X8 rim brake frameset 
This is a aero frame very good on high speed can easily achieve 30kmh 

I have put down 1000W with this frame and it very stiff and responsive 

only route 1200km on it 

My last build I weighed it at 7.4kg using SRAM rival 10speed groupset 

RFS :size incorrect and upgrade….

Reason price is cheap it’s because there are chip mark on the frame cause by chain drop hitting the frame ,can refer photo ,Other that that all parts of the frame are good have some scratches as well on the top tube and right rear fork due to leaning on wall mostly can refer photo. Even those de frame bb area is damaged but doesn’t feel it was spoiled 

Seatpost ,BB ,headset all included 
 
Fork cut very less still have a lot to play with 

Shifter cable and housing are still intact so easy to install or diy your self .Only the front brake housing u need to reroute yourself other then that just add cable and all good 

Price can nego if u are very interested 
Please do not waste my time asking stupid questions ,and not interested to buy

13,7,Bianchi Specialissima frameset,"4,299",Like new,Meetup,1 week ago,Road Bikes,Posted,Used once or twice. As good as new.,"Up for sale or trade is a mint condition Bianchi Specialissima frameset in Size 55.

This is an ex Pro team bike, raced by the actual Pros in Team Greenedge. Pro team frames have a different carbon layup, stiffer and lighter than your regular frames. The black on this frame is not paint, it’s clear coat over raw carbon to save weight!

Flatten climbs and complete your 8848/ le tape with ease!

Extremely light and responsive bike, stiff yet comfortable due to the counterveil technology.

Unfortunately this rare bird (probably the only one in Singapore) is too small for me now. Prior to my neck injury, I can still manage the aero position. I am open to trade it with a larger sized frameset 😊

Please note I am only selling the frameset + fork. Cockpit/seatpost/BB not included as I will be swapping them over to my next larger sized frameset.

*Cervelo C2* All rounder Road bike 
If you’re looking for a bike that handles both the daily commute and epic rides on the weekend, the C2 is a great choice. It combines Cervélo’s high performance pedigree with more relaxed geometry, wider tires, and a vibration-damping frame for an affordable and versatile bike.

The C2 will encourage you to keep racking up the miles. Our Endurance Fit riding position is designed for riders who want to ride for longer; the frame is tuned to smooth road vibrations; and wider tires (up to 32mm wide) increase comfort and traction.

The C2’s user-friendly features include: disc brakes compatible with all commonly used calipers and rotor sizes; thru axles for improved alignment and safety; and a down tube guard and chain stay protector to help prevent damage on mixed surfaces.

The lighter the bike, the easier it is to keep moving. The C2’s carbon frame is engineered to prioritize light weight and vibration-damping. That means a bike that’ll dance up the hills and feel comfortable all day long.

10,8,Factor Ostro Vam Framesets and Custom Build,"7,500",Brand new,Meetup,3 weeks ago,Road Bikes,Posted,Never used. May come with original packaging or tag.,"The OSTRO VAM is an ‘everything’ bike, a master of all trades. It's an ""Aero"" bike that is surprisingly light and super comfortable. The frame weighs only 830g for a painted size 54. It's not impossible to build below the UCI weight limit if you wish so.

One of the reasons you should consider buying the Ostro is that it doesn't have a tier level frame where you have to pay a higher price just to get the best. With the Factor Ostro Vam you get one level and that is the best and what the pros are riding. Another reason is that unlike other brands you are stuck with whatever they give you and you need to buy extra like stem length or bar widths. With Factor you are the boss and you get to choose. Last reason is that the frame will come with Ceramcspeed Bottom Bracket and Headset stock! No need for an upgrade.

Someone shorter shld be able to ride it too cause it is very fitting for me

Ordered this rim brake canyon cf sl 8 road bike on 30 Aug 2021, with 11 spd Shimano ultegra group set. This is the last batch of canyon with rim brakes! Easy to maintain and fix! I clean the bike each ride so this is very clean! Minimal scratches!

I have modified it to have a tri peak ceramic bb pf30 (don’t know how to prove this but I have the original ultegra bb to show u!)

I have also changed to aero rims: Reynolds ARX58

Bike value: 3727.90 incld taxes
Ceramic bb value: 100 I think
Reynolds ARX58 carbon aero rim retail price: 2200
The old alloy rim DT p1800 will be passed to you too in case you want spare rims.

Total value: 6027sgd
I don’t need the front mount so I shall pass it on to new owner.

All you need is a pair of pedals to start cycling!

I have upgraded my bike so this is a spare!

96,8,S-Works Tarmac SL5 below 7kg in excellent condition,"3,000 3,500",Lightly used,Meetup,3 months ago,Road Bikes,Posted,"Used with care. Flaws, if any, are barely noticeable.","** Will consider all reasonable offers **

This is an ultra-light S-Works Tarmac road bike. It is a very light and fast bike in exellent tip-top condition.

A genuine S-Works Tarmac SL5 with verifiable serial number intact (yes, there are many China fakes around). S-Works is Specializd Bikes's top-of-the line series (sold only at selected Specialized dealers). The quality and grade of carbon used is several tiers above standard Specialized models. Please note that this is an SL5 frameset, not older SL1, SL2, SL3, or SL4 Tarmac models. 

SPECiFICATIONS:

Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL5 carbon frameset and fork - Frame SIZE 54
Shimano Ultegra (latest Ultegra series) R8000 11-speed groupset 11-30 cassette
S-Works Crankset (carbon crank arms) 52/36T chainrings
Genuine KMC 11-speed chain recently installed  
Carbon wheelset 60mm depth with flat aero spokes
Continental Grandprix 4000 SII road tires (rated amongst the fasest)
4 extra sets of brake pads for carbon rims (ie, 16 pieces free)
Ultra-light carbon saddle with real leather wrap
Ultralight carbon bottle cage

My present set of ultralight TITANIUM Speedplay style pedals will be included (including cleats for your road shoe). I will fit a set of flat pedals for test rides.   

This is a very fast bike. Stiff and light, this bike is very efficient in converting peddling power to forward motion. Being so light, you will definitely feel its rapid acceleration. Light bikes are also faster uphill. Deeper wheels are noticibly faster on flats compared with shallow wheels, yet it is just marginally heavier and here, 60mm is considered a good balance. 

This bike is in excellent condition and I have only used it for exercise so it is really low mileage. Never been raced and never crashed. Always kept indoors in my air-conditioned living room, so its condition is excellent, with shiny paintwork.

Ernesto Colnago was born on February 9, 1932 in Cambiago, near Milan, Italy. At age 13 he entered in world of two wheels and immediately he fall in
love with bikes and cycling. In 1952 he founded Colnago and started to work as mechanic for
several professional teams. Colnago’s bikes still have a domination of the world’s cycling sports because Ernesto was always an innovator and pioneer of new technologies which supposedly
provide more efficency or comfort.
In response to criticism that Colnago frames were not stiff enough, Ernesto experimented with various crimped-tube frames. In 1983 he
introduced their top model “Master” and the
legend was born. The Master was constructed
 with famous “star shaped’ top, seat and down tube profile tubing called Columbus Gilco S4 designed by Gilberto Colombo to improve
performance. The first version of the Colnago Master was produced in years 1983-87, in 1990
Master Più was released. In 1993 Master Olympic was released, basically a Master Piu with more chromed parts and decor paint job.
Proudly presenting another legendary steel masterpiece from Cambiago - Colnago Master
Olympic Decor, which dates back 1990s. A superb frameset is made of verl light and stiff
Columbus Gilco S4 tubing with Precisa steel fork, shinning in outstanding Art Decor paint-job.

4,3,Wilier Filante SLR Disc Brake Frameset With Handlebar Astana 2023 (Size S / M) For Bicycle & Cycling,"7,280",Brand new,Mailing · Meetup,4 weeks ago,Road Bikes,Posted,Never used. May come with original packaging or tag.,"Colour: F9 ASTANA 2023, GLOSSY
Available Size:

***The price is including Handlebar***

FILANTE SLR
The new master in the art of aero

The natural evolution of Cento10PRO, our high-end aerodynamic bike used by professionals.

Filante SLR is an extremely lightweight aerodynamic bicycle with a significantly improved stiffness to weight ratio. We used the same materials and technology as in the construction of the Wilier 0 SLR.

The result is a top of the range, aerodynamic frame that complements our pure ascent bike used by Astana Qazaqstan Team.

AERODYNAMIC
Filante SLR was designed to maximise aerodynamic performance in real environmental conditions. The design was based on data recorded in the wind tunnel (where the wind is very clean for homogeneous empirical results) while also taking the real world into account. In this way, we not only evaluate typical wind tunnel data (yaw angles from -20° to + 20°), but also consider environmental turbulence that impacts the bike for many different reasons.
That’s why we redesigned the profiles, starting with the standard NACA airfoils/ KAMM tail that no longer have sharp edges on the back. The softened angles improve performance even when the air flow is disturbed.
The inside of the front fork has been widened by 7 mm, making it 13.6% wider than the Cento10PRO. In doing so, we moved the fork blades away from the wheel, reducing turbulence and improving aerodynamics.

LIGHTWEIGHT AND RESPONSIVE
The new aerodynamically optimised profiles helped us eliminate extra weight in the frame’s construction. The shape has no sharp edges, therefore requires less material and less resin in the corners. This improves homogeneity of the inside, reducing the frame’s weight to a mere 870 grams.
The assembled bike with top-of-the-range specifications weighs 6.8 kg.
The Filante monocoque handlebar is made of the same carbon we use for the Wilier 0 SLR. Thanks to the different types of carbon we used in combination with the Liquid-Crystal Polymer, the unique fibre positioning and the construction technology, we have reached an absolute level of lightness and stiffness.
The lower overall weight compared to the exceptional stiffness increases STW by 12.5%. This improvement is clearly felt with the steering precision and the feeling of safety at high speeds.

240 FITTINGS AVAILABLE
Since the fork steerer tube is no longer bevelled, we can install up to 35 mm of spacers under the handlebar. By combining frame sizes, handlebar sizes and spacers, we can achieve 240 different fittings, with no overlap between combinations. This doubles with the two available seat posts, with 15 mm or 0 mm setback.

HANDLEBAR AND INTEGRATED CABLES
In addition to being lightweight, (350 grams for the 101x42 size) the new integrated carbon monocoque Filante Bar handlebar houses the brake and derailleur cables, directing them toward the inside of the frame. Its design is very simple, with sinuous and rounded lines for maximum grip ergonomics.

EASY-FIT SPACERS
The spacers between the frame headset and the handlebar are made of a high-stiffness composite material, with a special cavity for the cables. They are composed of two parts for quick assembly and disassembly without interfering with the cables running from the handlebar to the frame.

BALANCED DESIGN
Six sizes, one feeling. The sections of the tubes of various sizes were designed to maintain consistent rigidity, handling quality and comfort on every frame size.

SPEED RELEASE THRU AXLE SYSTEM
Another new feature is the Mavic Speed Release thru axle system that enbles the wheel to be quickly removed from the frame. In this way the axle does not need to be totally extracted from the wheel hub. This solution significantly reduces wheel release and insertion time. During races, this solution cuts wheel change times by 7 seconds on average compared to a traditional thru axle system.

KEY PERFORMANCE FACTORS

Engineered compliance
Advanced Composite frame is specifically engineered for endurance road riding, giving you a smooth ride quality and less fatigue on long rides. The D-Fuse seatpost and handlebar absorb road shocks and vibrations.

Total control
Seamless disc brake integration, including flat mounts and 12mm front and rear thru-axles, produces more consistent braking power for better control, even in wet weather and rough roads.

Versatility
Endurance road geometry, added tyre clearance (up to 35mm) and disc-brake integration allow you to tackle a variety of roads and conditions, from smooth pavement to rugged mountain passes.

HIGHLIGHTS
Handcrafted with Advanced-grade composite material, the Defy Advanced is made with a specific carbon layup to give it an efficient, high-performance ride quality that helps you push new limits of endurance. The D-Fuse seatpost and handlebar system also help reduce road vibrations, adding to its smooth, compliant feel on the road. A tubeless Giant WheelSystem and tires boost speed and efficiency with a reduced risk of flats. And for added control, it features integrated disc brakes with flat-mount disc brake tabs and 12mm thru-axles.

As good as new.,"For sale is a like-new, beautiful size 49 S-Works Sagan Collection Disruption (no longer available on Specialized). Bought from T3 Nov-22 and rode only a few times - had to stop due to business travel and also as I started riding my TT bike more.

Bike is in top conditions with top-of-the-line parts, including:
- Duraace Di2 9170 11sp2 with 4iii dual-side power meter
- Carbon-Ti disc
- Rolf EOS 4 wheelset + Challenge Strada tyres
- Mcfk handlebar & stem
- Ceramic Speed B BB
- (The price is high because it comes with) A very special customized SLF Motion OSPW, which is full titanium gold colour, one of a few available

Happy to discuss on reducing the price to switch to Ceramic Speed OSPW or something else.

Pedal & Saddle are not included as I am using them on another bike but can discuss on including them too - the saddle is S-Works Power Mirror 143mm and pedal is Duraace. I can also let go of my Garmin Edge 1030 Plus PC if you would like to.

One of the better bikes I have ridden and would not let it go if not because... I have too many bikes and am into TT more now 😂

Feel free to DM to ask any questions.

2. Shimano Ultegra Di2 11 Speed Electronic Groupset
3. Shimano Dura Ace Disc Brake Disc RT-CL900 (160 Front / 140 Rear)
4. Shimano Ultegra Pedals coupled with Assioma Duo Power Meters
5. Lún Hyper 50mm Ride Bikes Bro Team Edition Wheelset with Coloured Spokes (Probably the only 1 in SG @ Guranteed Head Turner and also one of the wheelset that requires lesser watts from you to spin)
6. Michelin Power cup 28cc (Still Usable)

8. Fizik Antares Versus Envo R3 Adaptive Saddle
9. The One Integrated Handle Bar 42cm x 90cm (Carbon Fibre)
10. Ceramic Speed OSPW (Legit)
11. C-Bear Bottom Bracket
12. Rapidlock Thru Axial Wheel Mounting System (Way easier to secure and remove your wheels, eliminating the need to bring an Allen Key around and totally remove the risk of Allen key slot rounding)

As you can see, this bike is built to climb the heights, yet at the same time, it grants you effortless breakneck acceleration. Handlebar & Wheelset had also been carefully chosen to balance the bike between aerodynamics and weight saving.

The frame colour is Chameleon Green (Different colour under different angles and lighting condition), which camouflages the brand name that will make fellow cyclists curious about your bike brand and model, which serves as an ice breaker. The colour of the wheel spokes also will make fellow cyclists curious. I can say that this bike is loud yet at the same time, a stealthy bike.

Last measured, full bike setup weighs around 7.4kg.

If straight up deal and no negotiation, I will even throw in my Front Light (Enfitnix Navi800) and Radar Tail Light (Megane L508) + Garmin Edge 530 Asia, Coospo Wrist HRM and whatever accessories i can find to you for free.

Please take note:
-Carbon carbon wheelset tubes are flat (not sure if burst, I don’t recall it burst, just that I don’t ride bikes for a very long time)

I’m not cycling anymore so I don’t feel the need to send it for servicing. Lost interest, just dropping everything.

From the manufacturer 

Giant have a very purist approach to frame design. Unlike others using split frame design or frame inserts to achieve compliance or force distribution etc, Giant’s is a Pure Engineering approach and they have created a range of frames that out-perform the competition across the board, from stiffness and weight to compliance and strength.

Giant are in the business of creating high quality product that displays genuine value for money. To this end, their Advanced Pro ranges of carbon bikes - be that Defy, TCR or Propel - all use the high grade (and indeed benchmark) Torayca Carbon fibre married to high quality resins, in processes that they control from start to finish. The result is a range of the finest quality carbon bikes on the market.

The Defy Advanced Pro series retains the upgraded Torayca T700 carbon frameset of last year which it shares with it’s little brother; the Advanced. The difference between the two ranges is small but significant. The Advanced Pro range features a full carbon fork with carbon steerer (rather than aluminium) which makes for a more direct feeling front end and which also shaves weight from the bike. This fork also features Giant’s Overdrive 2 headtube which uses a 11/4” upper bearing and a 11/2” lower for exceptional handling and responsiveness. In addition, all Advanced Pro models feature Giants new saddles as developed with the Pro Team; upgraded finishing kit. Strong component selection at each price point in the Pro range make these ideal for those investing a lot of time in the saddle and who are keen sportive or endurance riders. This Defy Advanced Pro 1 is the bike for those looking for an electronic groupset to handle the rigours of their endurance riding. Shimano’s Ultegra Di2 is tried and tested and will yield effortless shifts mile after mile, rain or shine. Braking is handled by RS785 hydraulic discs for enhanced stopping in any and all conditions. The brake’s graduated lever feel ensures that you don’t launch yourself and the modulation is superb offering handfuls of control.

Engineered for real world performance, even on rough roads and the longest days. The Advanced grade composite frame features endurance geometry with the perfect blend of light weight, stiffness and road smoothing compliance. The OverDrive 2 steerer tube and full composite fork work together to boost front end stiffness and precision. New disc brake technology and the vibration damping D-Fuse seatpost enhance control and comfort. The PowerCore bottom bracket turns every pedal stroke into positive forward motion, helping you stay strong all the way to the finish.

Ordered this rim brake canyon cf sl 8 road bike on 30 Aug 2021, with 11 spd Shimano ultegra group set. This is the last batch of canyon with rim brakes! Easy to maintain and fix! I clean the bike each ride so this is very clean! Minimal scratches!

I have modified it to have a tri peak ceramic bb pf30 (don’t know how to prove this but I have the original ultegra bb to show u!)

I have also changed to aero rims: Reynolds ARX58

Ceramic bb value: 100 I think
Reynolds ARX58 carbon aero rim retail price: 2200
The old alloy rim DT p1800 will be passed to you too in case you want spare rims.

I don’t need the front mount so I shall pass it on to new owner.

All you need is a pair of pedals to start cycling!

18,7,Trifox x8 rim brake frameset size 54,300,Well used,Meetup,2 weeks ago,Road Bikes,Posted,Has minor flaws or defects.,"Selling my trifox X8 rim brake frameset 
This is a aero frame very good on high speed can easily achieve 30kmh 

I have put down 1000W with this frame and it very stiff and responsive 

only route 1200km on it 

My last build I weighed it at 7.4kg using SRAM rival 10speed groupset 

RFS :size incorrect and upgrade….

Reason price is cheap it’s because there are chip mark on the frame cause by chain drop hitting the frame ,can refer photo ,Other that that all parts of the frame are good have some scratches as well on the top tube and right rear fork due to leaning on wall mostly can refer photo. Even those de frame bb area is damaged but doesn’t feel it was spoiled 

Seatpost ,BB ,headset all included 
 
Fork cut very less still have a lot to play with 

Shifter cable and housing are still intact so easy to install or diy your self .Only the front brake housing u need to reroute yourself other then that just add cable and all good 

Price can nego if u are very interested 
Please do not waste my time asking stupid questions ,and not interested to buy 

price can nego 
Fast deal 200
